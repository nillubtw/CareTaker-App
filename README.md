# CareTaker-App
# Assistive Wearable Alert System

An **IoT-based assistive safety system** designed for disabled and elderly individuals that enables **hands-free emergency communication** with caretakers using a wearable device and a real-time mobile dashboard.

---

## Project Overview

This project integrates an **ESP32-based wearable**, a **Node.js gateway**, **Firebase Realtime Database**, and an **Android caretaker application** to create a **real-time, reliable emergency alert system**.

Users can trigger alerts using **gestures or sound patterns**, and caretakers receive instant notifications with the ability to **acknowledge alerts**, which are then reflected back on the wearable device.

- Real-time caretaker dashboard with active alerts and history
- Two-way acknowledgment system with wearable feedback
- Reliable backend using Firebase Realtime Database
- Emergency-focused UI for quick response

---

## Hardware Components

- ESP32
- INMP441 Digital Microphone
- ADXL345 Accelerometer
- GC9A01A TFT Display
- Power supply and supporting circuitry

---

## 📱 Software Stack

### Embedded System
- Arduino (ESP32)
- WiFi + HTTPClient
- I2S audio processing
- Sensor-based gesture detection

### Backend Server
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Firebase Admin SDK
- Firebase Realtime Database

### Mobile Application
- Android (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose)
- Firebase Realtime Database SDK
- Local notifications

---

## Alert Triggers

Alerts are generated by the wearable device when it detects:

- Sound patterns (Short hum / Long hum)
- Hand gestures (Left / Right)
- Emergency gestures (customizable)

Each alert contains:
- Alert type
- Timestamp
- Device ID
- Acknowledgment status

---

## Acknowledgment Flow

1. Caretaker receives alert on Android app  
2. Caretaker taps **ACKNOWLEDGE**  
3. Firebase updates alert status  
4. ESP32 detects acknowledgment  
5. Wearable displays **“ON THE WAY”** confirmation

## Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

This project supports the following UN SDGs:

- **SDG 3** – Good Health & Well-Being
- **SDG 9** – Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure
- **SDG 10** – Reduced Inequalities
- **SDG 11** – Sustainable Cities & Communities
